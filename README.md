"Very Secure Website" is a Cybersecurity project made for [HackSheffield8](https://hacksheffield-8.devpost.com/) designed and programmed by [Jack Sanders](https://github.com/jacksanders02), [James March](https://github.com/fokkos) and [Shamis Giaquinto](https://github.com/drcakechan).

The project is a mock/parody website where users are tasked with discovering and exploiting many commonly used exploitations, aiming to to teach first-year students about common attacks. It then provides advice and resources on how they would fix them for their own projects.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
